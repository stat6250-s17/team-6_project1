This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding the homicide rate over states in the United States from 2000-2014.
Dataset Name: Homicide reports, 2000-2014
STAT6250-02_s17-team-6_project1_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be
in the same directory as this file
See included file for dataset properties

* Research Question: What is the relationship between where the crime take place and the rate of the solved crimes? 
Rational: It helps to determine whether the geographic environment will have positive/negative impact on the case solving.
Methodology:
Possible follow-up steps: Any improvements in the code? Adjustment? Or the current methods don't apply to the dataset.

Research Question: Does the outcome shows that the there are more white victims than the other race came across murder in some specific states? 
Rational: It helps us to determine the relationship between race and state.
Methodology:
Possible follow-up steps: Any improvements in the code? Do we need to clean out any outliers? Is there any other SAS functions could also be applied to this data?

Research Question: What other factors might influence the outcome? 
Rational: Besides the factors listed as variables, we need to study the disturbing factors that might cause bias.
Methodology: 
Possible follow-up steps: Any improvements in the code? Check normality? Check other assumption? Is there any shortage of this method?

Reason for Choice: The topic appeals to me because it includes the homicide data set posted by FBI from 1980-2014. I can study the multi-relationship between the race, the perpetrator, sex, whether the case is solved or not, etc. It will be exciting when I run out my own data and compare the output with the others' and learn from them.
