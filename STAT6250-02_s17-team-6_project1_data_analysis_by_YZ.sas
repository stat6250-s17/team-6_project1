[Unique ID Schema] The column "Agency Code" is a primary key

[Research Question 1] What is the relationship between where the crime take place and the rate of the solved crimes? (Rational: It helps to determine whether the geographic environment will have positive/negative impact on the case solving)

[Research Question 2] Does the outcome shows that the there are more white victims than the other race came across murder in some specific states? (Rational: It helps us to determine the relationship between race and state)

[Research Question 3] What other factors might influence the outcome? (Rational: Besides the factors listed as variables, we need to study the disturbing factors that might cause bias)

[Reason for Choice] The topic appeals to me because it includes the homicide data set posted by FBI from 1980-2014. I can study the multi-relationship between the race, the perpetrator, sex, whether the case is solved or not, etc. It will be exciting when I run out my own data and compare the output with the others' and learn from them.
